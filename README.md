# EV Ejection

**Emergency Battery Ejection System for Electric Vehicles**  
A conceptual failsafe to prevent extended lithium-ion fire scenarios.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

Electric vehicle (EV) battery fires are rare but can be catastrophic, lasting hours or even days, releasing toxic pollutants, endangering first responders, and harming local air and water systems.

This project proposes a conceptual safety mechanism: an **automated or emergency-triggered ejection system** to physically detach the lithium battery tray from the vehicle **before ignition or runaway thermal reaction occurs**.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

- Many EVs store their lithium-ion battery trays in the **floor of the vehicle**.
- In the event of fire, sensors or user input could trigger an **ejection or drop-release system**.
- The goal is not to prevent a fire entirely, but to **remove the most dangerous material before it worsens**.

---

## 💡 Project Intent

This is not a prototype, patent claim, or monetized product.  
It is an **open environmental safety concept**, released in the interest of:

- Reducing fire-related ecological harm
- Encouraging engineering discussion and innovation
- Protecting first responders and civilians

The idea is offered under **CC BY 4.0**, with only one request: that all adaptations and uses **credit WhyTrashEarth**.

## 🏗️ Contributions Welcome

If you're an EV engineer, firefighter, material scientist, or battery safety specialist — we invite your input.

We don't need perfection. We need **prevention.**
